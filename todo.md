### TODO

- Create a bash script to edit hosts, vhosts and configure ServerName
- Add parameter class for variables (such as MySQL info)
- Enable PHP error displaying by default (still necessary with laravel?)
- Allow skipping installation of laravel with a parameter in puppet
- Add optional module for nodejs
- Add list of modules and their packages to readme.md
- Check if ruby is a dependency for vagrant or puppet
- install laravel through composer instead of puppet (or through composer with puppet?)
- stuff
