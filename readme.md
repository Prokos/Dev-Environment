This is my personal vagrant / puppet dev environment repository. 

Used for future personal projects and the learning of vagrant, puppet and server management in general.

### Dependencies

You must have [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) installed in order for this to work.

### Setup

Download the .zip of this repository, and unzip it into a new folder.
Navigate to the folder from your terminal and run `vagrant up`, once you see `notice: Finished catalog run` the environment should be accessible on http://localhost:1337/
